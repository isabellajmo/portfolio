# Isabella Mo | Electrical Engineering Portfolio
> **Analog, Digital, and Mixed-Signal Systems**

Welcome to my technical portfolio. I specialize in bridging high-level software abstraction with low-level hardware implementation, with a focus on FPGA acceleration and precision instrumentation.

## 🛠 Featured Projects

### 🔳 [High-Throughput Matrix Multiplication Accelerator](matrix-multiplier.md)
**HDL/Architecture** | Optimized Verilog MAC units and Dual-Port RAM for 2x data throughput.

### 🎲 [FPGA-Based Dice Game Controller](dice-game.md)
**Digital Logic** | Complex Mealy FSM design with One-Hot encoding and BCD arithmetic.

### ⚖️ [High-Resolution Jelly Bean Counting Scale](precision-scale.md)
**Mixed-Signal** | 0.5g resolution measurement system with INA125 amplification and EMI mitigation.

### 🐄 [IoT "Cowtastrophe" Multi-User Game](cowtastrophe.md)
**Software/Cloud** | MATLAB OOP-based engine synchronized via ThingSpeak Cloud API.

### ⌚ [Raynaud’s Syndrome Preventative Armband](raynauds-armband.md)
**Embedded Systems** | Arduino-based wearable prototype for medical-assistive thermal alerts.
