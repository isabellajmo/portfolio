# Raynaud’s Syndrome Preventative Armband
> **Tools:** Arduino, C++, DHT11 Sensor, Rapid Prototyping

## 🎯 Project Objective
Create a wearable medical-assistive device to alert users of thermal triggers ($<60^{\circ}\text{F}$).



## 🛠 Technical Implementation
* **Sensing:** Continuous polling of a DHT11 thermistor for ambient temperature monitoring.
* **Feedback Debugging:** Transitioned from active to **passive buzzers** to enable frequency-modulated alerts.
* **Ergonomics:** Designed for low-power operation and a compact footprint for daily wearable use.

## 🔍 R&D Insight
The switch to a passive buzzer was critical for providing varied alert tones that could be distinguished from environmental noise.
